Sometimes Customs can sit on packages and it may take longer than typical shipping. It is out of my control.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; I am not responsible for lost or damaged items. Tracking is attached to each order&#39;s receipt so I will know if the packages have arrived at their destination.&lt;&lt;\r\n\r\nOrders are not considered &quot;Lost&quot; in transit until the following amount of time has passed:\r\nDomestic (US): 21 business days past shipping date.\r\nInternational: 45 business days past shipping date.\r\n\r\nPurchasing Gifts for 2015 CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY: United States- You must purchase NO LATER than Dec. 2 to receive it by Christmas. If you purchase later than the 2nd, I cannot guarantee it&#39;s arrival by Christmas. You may purchase faster shipping for an additional fee. \r\nINTERNATIONAL Christmas Sales - Please order NO LATER than Nov. 13.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that during the holiday season, USPS is flooded with deliveries. This may cause slower shipping travel times. Please plan accordingly. I ship out on the time promised, but if USPS slows it down and it is late, I have no control over it.\r\n\r\nIf your package says it has been DELIVERED, but you do not see it, please keep in mind that my store has no control over it, and I cannot offer a refund. It is completely in the hands of USPS and they are responsible. What I can do is provide advice on this rare situation. Here are the steps to take. \r\nAsk your household if someone else got the mail that day and forgot to tell you it arrived. That is typically what happened. \r\nGo in to your local post office, with your tracking number and inquire where your package is.They can talk to the worker who actually dropped it off. They scan the package as &quot;Delivered&quot; as they drop it off. \r\nIf neither solves this, and you believe it is stolen, please contact your local authorities.","policy_refunds":"                                ---REFUNDS & EXCHANGES---\r\n\r\nRefunds and Exchanges only up to 14 days after you have received your purchase. No exceptions. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied or there is something is wrong with your purchase within those 14 days, please contact me before leaving negative or neutral feedback, and I will do my best to help correct it.\r\n\r\nNONRETURNABLE Items:\r\nEarring, Belly Rings, Nose Rings, and Industrial Bars are nonreturnable for any reason, due to sanitation issues. \r\nCustom Orders, Bulk or Wedding Packages since it was a ordered and made specifically for the customer.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a refund or exchange, I request on having the item shipped back to me. Buyer pays shipping back to me. Once received, I will return the cost of the item only. \r\n\r\n** It must be packaged safely. If it arrives to me damaged, there will be NO refunds. Do NOT use plain white letter envelopes to mail items back, because items will rip the envelope and fall out. I cannot refund an item if it isn&#39;t there. It must be shipped back in a padded envelope or safely in a box.\r\n\r\nBe sure you provide me the correct address. If it is returned to me for a bad address, I will refund for item purchase amount only and you may repurchase.\r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"I love receiving positive feedback here on Etsy! All 5 Star Customer Feedback will receive a Discount Coupon for their next purchase!!\r\n\r\nA reminder that if there is a problem with an item you received, please message me to work the situation out before leaving a neutral or negative comment.\r\nPlease also keep in consideration that it is unfair to punish any business (by removing stars) for the delays or speed of USPS.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nPRODUCT CARE: Make your handmade jewelry last! Please DO NOT wear jewelry in the shower or while swimming. Sleeping with belly rings on or during physical activities may cause breakages. \r\n\r\nDO NOT use liquid cleaners to clean jewelry. Dry polishing cloths will do the job. \r\n\r\nBULK or WEDDING PACKAGES: Please Contact me for price quotes. Bulk is classified as 5+ of the same item. \r\nI have many people buying for weddings, gifts, and school dances. They are already spending enough, I feel as though they deserve a price break. Plus they chose my store to make their moments a little more special! \r\n\r\nSALES and GIVEAWAYS: I often run sales and do monthly giveaways.

Grapevine wreaths are each unique and slightly different, which will cause each final product to vary.\r\n\r\nGrapevine wreaths are not always the exact same size and can vary up to a few inches. If you need your wreath to be an exact size to fit your door please let me know when your order is placed. \r\n\r\nI carefully package each item for safe shipping so some flowers, burlap, and bows may flatten slightly, however they will return to their original shape with a little fluffing and adjusting. . \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions at all please do not hesitate to contact me!!!","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1427316974,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SolidWoodDoor?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/10534231\/iusb_760x100.14853875_iteo.jpg","num_favorers":237,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/10534231\/isla_fullxfull.15819352_g3qpk9ru.jpg"}},{"listing_id":250436407,"state":"active","user_id":34464444,"category_id":69150433,"title":"Chevron Print Football  SVG Cutter Design INSTANT DOWNLOAD","description":"This design is perfect for vinyl.
